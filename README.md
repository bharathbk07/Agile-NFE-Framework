# Agile-NFE Framework - Jenkins Pipeline Documentation

This `Jenkinsfile` defines a CI/CD pipeline for automating the deployment of the application and ensuring it complies with non-functional engineering (NFE) standards. The pipeline covers key aspects such as **performance testing**, **static code scanning**, and **chaos engineering**. Once all stages are successfully completed, an email is triggered to stakeholders, indicating that the application is ready for deployment.

## Shift-Left or Shift-Right Approach?
This pipeline follows a **shift-left approach** by integrating testing (performance and static code analysis) early in the CI/CD process. Shift-left practices help catch issues earlier in the development cycle, minimizing risks and reducing the cost of fixing defects. Additionally, chaos engineering introduces a **shift-right component** by validating the resilience of the application in production-like scenarios, ensuring that the system behaves reliably under real-world conditions.

---

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. **Load Configuration**
- Reads the YAML configuration file (`configfile.yml`).
- Sets environment variables for JMeter and chaos experiments.
- Loads project details such as GitHub repository URL and branch name.

### 2. **Clone Repository**
- Clones the source code from the specified GitHub repository and branch.

### 3. **Static Code Analysis (SonarQube)**
- Uses SonarQube to perform static code analysis.
- Requires a configured SonarQube installation named `Wordsmith` in Jenkins.
- Uses credentials from Jenkins (`SonarQube_Wordsmith`) to authenticate.
- Executes Maven commands to analyze code and submit reports to SonarQube.

#### SonarQube Configuration
- Ensure SonarQube is installed and accessible at `http://localhost:9000`.
- In Jenkins:
  1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** -> **Global Tool Configuration**.
  2. Under **SonarQube Servers**, add a new server with the name **Wordsmith**.
  3. Create a **SonarQube Token** and store it in Jenkins Credentials with the ID `SonarQube_Wordsmith`.

- Maven command used:
  ```bash
  mvn clean verify sonar:sonar \
    -Dsonar.projectKey=<project_key> \
    -Dsonar.projectName=<project_name> \
    -Dsonar.host.url=<sonarqube_url> \
    -Dsonar.login=<SONAR_TOKEN>
  ```

### 4. **Validate and Deploy Docker**
- Checks if Docker is running on the Mac node.
- Builds and deploys the application using Docker Compose.
- Verifies if the containers are running post-deployment.

### 5. **JMeter Performance Testing**
- Executes performance tests using JMeter if enabled in the configuration.
- Generates reports in HTML format at the specified directory.

### 6. **Run Chaos Experiment**
- Initiates a CPU-based chaos experiment using Gremlin.
- Requires Gremlin API credentials in Jenkins (`GREMLIN_API_KEY` and `GREMLIN_TEAM_ID`).
- Logs the attack details and provides a link to view them in the Gremlin dashboard.

### 7. **Run Frontend Performance Testing with Lighthouse**
- Uses Lighthouse to perform a performance scan on the specified webpage.
- Generates a detailed performance report, including metrics like page load time, accessibility, SEO, and best practices.
- **Prerequisites**: Ensure that Lighthouse is installed and configured in Jenkins for scanning.

### 8. **Accessibility Testing with Pa11y**

## Run Accessibility Testing with Pa11y
- Uses **Pa11y** to perform accessibility scans on specified webpages.
- Provides detailed accessibility reports, including issues and WCAG compliance.
- **Prerequisites**: Ensure that Pa11y is installed and configured in your environment.

## Features

### 1. **Automated Accessibility Testing**
   - Quickly identifies accessibility issues across webpages.
   - Supports **WCAG 2.1** (A, AA, AAA) compliance checks.

### 2. **Flexible Reporting**
   - Supports multiple report formats, including **CSV**, **JSON**, and **HTML**.
   - Easily integrates with **CI/CD pipelines** for continuous monitoring.

### 3. **Integration Options**
   - Works with **Pa11y Dashboard** for centralized report management.
   - Compatible with popular CI tools like **Jenkins**.

### Notifications and Updates
- **Slack Notification**: Sends a notification to the designated Slack channel once the build and performance scan are completed.
- **Email Notification**: Sends an email update to the configured recipients, providing the build and scan results.
- **Jira Update**: Automatically updates the Jira story linked to the current build with the build status and performance testing results.

---

## Pros of This Approach
1. **Early Defect Detection**: Catches code quality and performance issues early in the development cycle (shift-left).
2. **Automated Compliance**: Ensures that the application meets NFE standards such as code quality, performance, and reliability.
3. **Improved System Resilience**: Chaos experiments help validate the application's behavior under stress (shift-right).
4. **End-to-End Automation**: Minimizes manual effort by automating the entire process from testing to deployment readiness notifications.

## Post Execution Actions
- **Always**: Cleans up the workspace after execution.
- **Success**: Logs success message and triggers an email to stakeholders indicating deployment readiness.
- **Failure**: Logs failure message and prompts for log review.

---
## How to Use
1. Update `configfile.yml` with relevant configurations.
2. Ensure all prerequisites are fulfilled.
3. Run the pipeline from Jenkins and monitor the logs for each stage.

## Install and Use Gremlin with Docker
1. Store your Gremlin agent credentials as environment variables, for example
```bash
export GREMLIN_TEAM_ID=your_team_id
```
```bash
export GREMLIN_TEAM_SECRET=your_secert_key
```
2. Next run the Gremlin Daemon in a Container.Use docker run to pull the official Gremlin Docker image and run the Gremlin daemon
```bash
docker run -d --net=host \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --cap-add=SYS_BOOT --cap-add=SYS_TIME \
  --cap-add=KILL \
  -v $PWD/var/lib/gremlin:/var/lib/gremlin \
  -v $PWD/var/log/gremlin:/var/log/gremlin \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e GREMLIN_TEAM_ID="$GREMLIN_TEAM_ID" \
  -e GREMLIN_TEAM_SECRET="$GREMLIN_TEAM_SECRET" \
  -e GREMLIN_CLIENT_TAGS="foo=bar" \
  gremlin/gremlin daemon
```
3. Use `docker ps `to see all running Docker containers
4. Jump into your Gremlin container with an interactive shell (replace b281e749ac33 with the real ID of your Gremlin container)
```bash
sudo docker exec -it b281e749ac33 /bin/bash
```
5. From within the container, check out the available attack types:
```bash
gremlin help attack-container
```

---

## Troubleshooting
- If Docker is not running, start it and retry.
- For SonarQube login failures, ensure the correct token is used.
- Verify Gremlin credentials if the chaos experiment fails to initiate.

## Pipeline Execution
This pipeline automates the entire CI/CD workflow, ensuring code quality, performance testing, and resilience checks through chaos engineering.
